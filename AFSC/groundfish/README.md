# Template for starting AFSC groundfish asseessments

## Initial cut is to get exec summary tables done for all tiers
Also, contains a rough structure from SAFE report guidelines. Co-opts a single file "maintext.Rmd" as child from t1.Rmd and t3.Rmd.

The summary table is initiated (for now) based on simple table found in data subdirectory. t3.dat is a tier 3 example, t1.dat for tier 1.

Tiers 4 and 5 to come...
